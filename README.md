# pcf-usage-report-generator

Scripts to generate PCF usage reports for AIs, SIs and Tasks, inspired by this great [cf-tools](https://github.com/rakutentech/cf-tools).

There are three types of usage reports:
- Application Instance (AI)
- Service Instance (SI)
- Task

> Disclaimer: 
> The scripts here are purely for learning purposes on how to interact with PCF's accounting [APIs](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/opsguide/accounting-report.html). They're still under development and may be buggy at the moment. All accounting results generated here are just for reference ONLY and the actual accounting results shall follow what accounting reports are generated by PCF's Apps Manager.


# Prerequisites

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) >=1.5 installed
- [cf](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) command line tool installed
- Logged into PCF using `cf login`

> Note: if you want to generate usage reports for all orgs, login with admin account instead


# Generate Usage Reports

Given below inputs: 
1) the sys domain of PCF: sys.pcf.mycompany.com
2) the starting from date (YYYY-mm-dd) to calculate: 2018-01-12

So we export them as below:
```sh
$ export SYS_DOMAIN=sys.pcf.mycompany.com
$ export USAGE_START_DATE="2018-01-01"
```


## Application Instances (AI): `pcf-usage-report-ai.sh`

This is used to generate detailed AI usage reports in one single cli call.

Below are some common usage examples.

1. Take a look at the usage first:

```sh
./pcf-usage-report-ai.sh -h
Usage: pcf-usage-report-ai.sh [OPTION]...

  -s <sort field>           sort by specified field index or its name
  -S <sort field>           sort by specified field index or its name (numeric)
  -f <field1,field2,...>    show only fields specified by indexes or field names
  -c <minutes>              filter objects created within last <minutes>
  -u <minutes>              filter objects updated within last <minutes>
  -C <minutes>              filter objects created more than <minutes> ago
  -U <minutes>              filter objects updated more than <minutes> ago
  -k <minutes>              update cache if older than <minutes> (default: 10)
  -n                        ignore cache
  -N                        do not format output and keep it tab-separated (useful for further processing)
  -j                        print json (filter and sort options are not applied when -j is in use)
  -v                        verbose
  -o <org1,org2...>         a list of orgs to be used for usage generation, separated by commas
  -d                        usage calculation starting date, YYYY-MM-DD
  -h                        display this help and exit
```

2. To generate AI usage report with specified ORG (e.g. dev here) and desired fields only, in "browsing" mode:

```sh
$ ./pcf-usage-report-ai.sh -D ${SYS_DOMAIN} -d ${USAGE_START_DATE} -o dev -f year,month,org_name,instance_count,memory_in_mb_per_instance,duration_in_seconds
```

Which will output something like:

```
year  month  org_name  instance_count  memory_in_mb_per_instance  duration_in_seconds
2018  01     dev       1               1024                       1724051
2018  01     dev       1               1024                       182900
2018  01     dev       1               512                        2005
2018  01     dev       1               768                        1854941
2018  01     dev       2               2048                       2678400
2018  02     dev       1               1024                       139019

2018  02     dev       1               1024                       2419200
2018  02     dev       1               1024                       58570
2018  02     dev       1               512                        16

3. To generate AI usage report with specified ORG (e.g. dev here) and desired fields only, with a TAB separated format which will be easier for further processing:

```sh
$ ./pcf-usage-report-ai.sh -D ${SYS_DOMAIN} -d ${USAGE_START_DATE} -o dev -f year,month,org_name,instance_count,memory_in_mb_per_instance,duration_in_seconds -N > ai-dev.csv
```

Below are some common usage examples.

1. Take a look at the usage first:

```sh
./pcf-usage-report-task.sh -h
Usage: pcf-usage-report-task.sh [OPTION]...

  -s <sort field>           sort by specified field index or its name

  -n                        ignore cache
  -N                        do not format output and keep it tab-separated (useful for further processing)
  -j                        print json (filter and sort options are not applied when -j is in use)
  -v                        verbose
  -h                        display this help and exit

  -d                        usage calculation starting date, YYYY-MM-DD
```

2. To generate Task usage report with specified ORG (e.g. dev here) and desired fields only, in "browsing" mode:

```sh
$ ./pcf-usage-report-task.sh -D ${SYS_DOMAIN} -d ${USAGE_START_DATE} -o dev -f year,month,org_name,app_name,task_count,total_duration_in_seconds,memory_in_mb_per_instance
```

Which will output something like:

```
year  month  org_name  app_name  task_count  total_duration_in_seconds  memory_in_mb_per_instance
2018  05     dev       lattice   1           2                          1024
```

> Tips:
> - if the records are more than one screen, please hit ENTER to browse the rest; Key in "q" to exit
> - typically, there are just few task records, depending on how the ORG uses PCF


3. To generate Task usage report with specified ORG (e.g. dev here) and desired fields only, with a TAB separated format which will be easier for further processing:

```sh
$ ./pcf-usage-report-task.sh -D ${SYS_DOMAIN} -d ${USAGE_START_DATE} -o dev -f year,month,org_name,app_name,task_count,total_duration_in_seconds,memory_in_mb_per_instance -N > task-dev.csv
```

# Process Usage Reports

Let's use Excel as example to establish better usage analysis reports
The steps are exactly the same for all types of usage reports, as below:
-> Open Excel
-> Click File
-> Click Import
-> Choose default "CSV file" and click Import
-> Browse and choose the file generated, click "Get Data"
-> In the "Text Import Wizard" step 1 of 3, make sure "Delimited" is selected, click Next
-> In the "Text Import Wizard" step 2 of 3, make sure "Tab" is selected as the delimitter, click Next
-> In the "Text Import Wizard" step 2 of 3, click Finish
-> In the "Import Data" promt, choose "New sheet" to place our imported data


## AI Reports

Add two more necessary fields: instance_hours and memory_hours.

The formula for these two fields:
- instance_hours  = instance_count * (duration_in_seconds / 3600)
- memory_hours    = instance_count * (memory_in_mb_per_instance / 1024) * (duration_in_seconds / 3600)

> Tips:
> - You may add a Pivot table for better analysis
> - Please refer to the sample spreadsheet [ai-analysis.xlsx](analysis/ai-analysis.xlsx) for details


## SI Reports

Add one more necessary field: service_instance_hours.

The formula for this field:
- service_instance_hours  = duration_in_seconds / 3600

> Tips:
> - You may add a Pivot table for better analysis
> - Please refer to sample spreadsheet [si-analysis.xlsx](analysis/si-analysis.xlsx) for details


## Task Reports

Tasks are similar to Apps, one may add two more necessary fields: instance_hours and memory_hours.

The formula for these two fields:
- instance_hours  = instance_count * (duration_in_seconds / 3600)
- memory_hours    = instance_count * (memory_in_mb_per_instance / 1024) * (duration_in_seconds / 3600)

> Tips:
> - You may add a Pivot table for better analysis
> - Please refer to the sample spreadsheet [task-analysis.xlsx](analysis/task-analysis.xlsx) for details

# Known Issues

## `jq` Errors

If you encountered errors like:
```sh
jq: error (at <stdin>:1): Cannot index number with string "xxx"
```
Or
```sh
jq: error (at <stdin>:180): Cannot iterate over null (null)
```

It's mainly caused by no records found.
Please check whether you keyed in corret inputs like org name.

Will improve the scripts' robustness in future.
